Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Because it is a reliable way to keep track of the versions of our code

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could be applied to finance. For example, if there is a lot of unusual 
        transactions we could be able to identify them using data science techniques.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Rebasing consists of putting the changes of a branch on top of another and keeping
        a linear history. This may remove unnecesary merge commits, although it could be risky.
        On the other hand, merging simply conserves both branches and joins one into another,
        preserving the original changes done to each branch.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I am looking forward to learn a lot about data science techniques, databases and machine learning
        algorithms to make accurate decisions based on the given data.
